## Objectives

To gain experience with

- working with branches


## Exercise 1: Time Calculator

Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of seconds.

- There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 60, the program should display the number of minute(s) in that many seconds.
- There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, the program should display the number of hour(s) in that many seconds.
- There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 86,400, the program should display the number of day(s) in that many seconds.

**Note**: You should have a different output if the result is one. Be careful: 1 minute is not the same as 1 minutes, 2 minutes is not the same as 2 minute, etc.


## Exercise 2: More branches

Your goal is to build a simple menu system:

Ask the user “What do you want to do tonight?”, with the options:

a. Go to the movies  (Response: “I know just the movie to see!”)
b. Eat out  (Response: “Great! I’ve been wanting to try that new Tuvaluan restaurant!”)
c. Hang out at the Mall  (Response: “You bring the cash!”)
d. Go watch the Dodgers  (Response: “Take me out to the ball game”)

Any other choice should get the response: “Nothing suits you, then? I guess we’ll just stay and program!”


Your menu must be "user friendly" - i.e. it should understand either 'a' or 'A' as user input. Use compound boolean expressions to handle this.  DO NOT USE A SWITCH STATEMENT!!!


DO NOT copy and paste from assignment or any other fancy word editing program. Not all characters translate easily and sometimes there are hidden characters. This is especially true for characters like apostrophes.
